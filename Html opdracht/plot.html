        <h1>Plot</h1>

        <p class="description">Long before the game's events, the legendary hero Erdrick used the Ball of Light to drive darkness away from the kingdom of Alefgard. Erdrick handed the Ball of Light to King Lorik, bringing Alefgard into an age of prosperity and keeping winters short in the kingdom.</p>

        <p class="description">However, one man hid from the Ball of Light's radiance in a mountain cave. While exploring the cave's underground tunnels, he awoke a sleeping dragon who knelt before him instead of attacking. The mountain man learned dark magic and became known as the Dragonlord.</p>

        <p class="description">One day, the Dragonlord summoned a fleet of dragons to raze the town of Brecconary and stole the Ball of Light from Tantegel Castle. Monsters appeared across the entire continent; much of the land turned into poisonous marshes; several towns were permanently destroyed; and The Dragonlord's Castle rose from the earth.</p>

        <p class="description">Erdrick returned to offer his help to King Lorik and found the Dragonlord on an island only accessed through a Rainbow Drop. He then traveled to the island, but disappeared. Throughout the next decades, the prophet Mahetta foretold the coming of a descendant of Erdrick to defeat the Dragonlord.</p>

        <p class="description">During the reign of King Lorik XVI, the Dragonlord attacked Tantegel Castle again, kidnapped Princess Gwaelin and began terrorizing Alefgard's citizens. By this time, Erdrick's story had been nearly forgotten; many would-be heroes had been killed trying to rescue Gwaelin; and Mahetta's prophecy had been dismissed as a fairy tale.</p>
